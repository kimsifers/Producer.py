#	* Please refer to the [Kafka Connect JDBC Source Connector Configuration Options](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/source-#connector/source_config_options.html) for documentation on the options you must complete.
#	* You can run this file directly to test your connector, rather than running the entire simulation.
#	* Make sure to use the [Landoop Kafka Connect UI](http://localhost:8084) and [Landoop Kafka Topics UI](http://localhost:8085) to check the status and output of #the Connector.
#	* To delete a misconfigured connector: `CURL -X DELETE localhost:8083/connectors/stations`

#First, use the REST API to check the connector status. curl http:<connect_url>/connectors/<your_connector>/status to see what the status of your connector is
#Next, use the REST API to check the task status for the connector. curl http:<connect_url>/connectors/<your_connector>/tasks/<task_id>/status to see what the status #of your task is
#If you canâ€™t deduce the failure from these two options, the next best bet is to examine the logs of Kafka Connect. Typically, a tool like tail or less is useful in #examining the logs for Kafka Connect. On Linux systems, Kafka Connect logs are often available in /var/log/kafka/. Kafka Connect is often verbose and will indicate #what the issue is that it is experiencing.
